# Changed Data Capture (CDC)
- Technique to detect and capture row-level inserts, updates, deletes in a database.
- Send only the changes (not full data) to downstream systems in real time or near real time.
- Use cases: Replication, event-driven systems, analytics pipelines, cache sync.
- Types:
  - Log-based CDC
    - Reads transaction logs (e.g., MySQL binlog, Postgres WAL).
  - Trigger-based CDC
    - Uses DB triggers to write changes into a change table.
  - Timestamp / Version column CDC
    - Track changes using last_updated or version column.
  - Table Diffing (Polling)
    - Compare snapshots periodically.
  - Key Technical Terms
    - Transaction Log / WAL â†’ recording all intended changes to a sequential, append-only log file before the changes are applied to the main data files
    - CDC is a real-time, incremental alternative to batch ETL, implemented via log-based, trigger-based, timestamp-based, or diff-based methods, and is critical for replication, streaming, and modern data pipelines.
