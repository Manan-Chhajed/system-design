Databases
1. Read heavy database
  i. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and Caching Systems
    a. Redis: An in-memory key-value store often used for caching to speed up read operations.
    b. Memcached: Another in-memory caching system designed for quick data retrieval.
  ii. E-commerce
    a. Amazon DynamoDB: Optimized for fast and consistent read performance, often used in e-commerce for product catalogs.
    b. Elasticsearch: Frequently used for searching and filtering product catalogs due to its efficient read capabilities.
  iii. Social Media
    a. Cassandra: Known for its high availability and scalability, suitable for read-heavy workloads like social media feeds.
    b. MongoDB: A NoSQL database that can be optimized for read-heavy applications like user profiles.
2. Write heavy database
  1. Financial Transaction Systems
    a. PostgreSQL: A relational database known for its reliability and ACID compliance, making it suitable for financial transactions.
    b. MySQL (with InnoDB): Another relational database with strong transaction support, commonly used in financial systems.
  2. Sensor data collection
    a. Apache Kafka: While not a traditional database, Kafka is often used as a high-throughput write-heavy pipeline for ingesting sensor data, which is then written to a database like Cassandra.
